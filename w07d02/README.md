# W07D02 - What is React State?

### To Do
- [x] Review of components and props
- [x] What is state?
- [x] Closure review
- [x] Reading and setting state

### State
* data that belongs to a component
* props are data that is passed into a component
* data that is likely to change over time
* if state changes, the component automatically re-renders (re-called)

### Hooks
* JavaScript helper functions
* built into React
* added in February 2019
* "hook" into various parts of React
* every single hook starts with the prefix "use"
* all hooks MUST be called in the exact same order on every render


Triggering a re-render
* old props !== new props
* old state !== new state
* shallow comparison (compares references)


virtual DOM is a copy of the actual DOM
any update to state changes the virtual DOM

React compares the virtual DOM against the actual DOM
Makes only the changes needed
